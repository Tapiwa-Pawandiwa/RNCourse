# RNCourse

A simple goal listing application with the ability to add goals and delete goals in a list. 
This application was built as part of my Udemy course "React Native - The Practical Guide [2022]" 
The purpose is to get to terms with React Native components and syntax. 


This application exposed me to the following components which I wasnt too familiar with before taking this project on : 

* Modal
* View 
* Pressable
* StyleSheet
* Text
* TextInput 

It is also quite nice to be exposed to expo where you can work and simutaneously view the changes to your application.
